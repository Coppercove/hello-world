# hello-world
My first repository; hopefully of many.

Hello fellow nerds :), 
  My name is Adam and this is my First time on Github. I am currently taking classes for Computer Science, but have been thinking of changing it and getting my Web Design Certificate. I became very interested this semester when I took the Intro to HTML class. Back in the day I loved coding my MySpace page and have always had a passion for anything with computers. I hope to find a job within my career field within the next few months so that I can gain some experience. From what Ive learned, experience is just as important, if not more, ashaving a degree. I look forward to learning on GitHub and having fun!
